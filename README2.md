# scp-database
 The SCP wiki, SCP international wiki and other similar sites. External sister sites such as the wanderer library may be added soon, the 05 command site will not be downloaded as it has restricted (wiki staff only) pages and we would like to respect that, however we may add public pages soon. Please check scp-wiki.wikidot.com for all SCP's and full credits.
